# Code Review Practice

## Principle

- ### Code

  1. Design: The code is well-designed.
  2. Complexity: The code isnâ€™t more complex than it needs to be.
  3. Tests: Code has appropriate unit tests.
  4. Naming:The developer used clear names for everything.
  5. Style: The code conforms to our style guides.
  6. Consistency: encourage the author to file a bug and add a TODO for cleaning up existing code.

- ### Docs

   1. Comments: Comments are clear and useful, and mostly explain why instead of what.
   2. Documentation: Code is appropriately documented (generally in g3doc).

- ### UX

  1. Functionality: The functionality is good for the users of the code.
