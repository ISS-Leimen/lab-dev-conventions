# Branch Naming Convention

## Principle

 1. Use Separators “/” to separate `branch_author/branch_name`
 2. Include Author Name in front of the branch
 3. Use lowercase letters only
 4. Branch Name Start Name with Category/Special Words

## Category

- hotfix : changing code with a temporary solution
- bugfix : for fixing a bug
- feature : for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
- docs : for adding or changing documentation
- test : (rare) for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket (trying to explore a known issue)
- wip : (rare) for a work in progress (only use for free experimentation)

## Example

`<author>/<category>-<branch_purpose>`
  The purpose of this branch
Ex :

- taylor/hotfix-unable-to-generate-survey
- jerry/feat-add-new-survey-chart
- tiffany/test-google-oauth-authenticate
