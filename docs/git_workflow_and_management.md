# git workflow and  management

## GitHub Flow Considerations

  1. Any code in the main branch should be deployable.
  2. Create new descriptively-named branches off the main branch for new work, such as `feature/add-new-payment-types`.
  3. Commit new work to your local branches and regularly push work to the remote.
  4. To request feedback or help, or when you think your work is ready to merge into the main branch, open a pull request.
  5. After your work or feature has been reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the main branch.
